# Data Augmentation 

What data augmentation does ? 

Altereing the images to give us more data, which draws a better picture  between input and output data hence helps in optimizing the loss.

Relation between amount of data and accuracy is exponential. If 100 images help increase the accuracy by 1% we would need another 1000 images to increase next 1%





Types of Data Augmentation: 



PMDA

MMDA

RMDA





Poor Mans Data Augmentation -  Add invariance to image and produce multiple image of one image. But how useful is it to our model/network.

 But the labels have not changes which is not true, Car rotated vertically label is changes and never see a car like that.
