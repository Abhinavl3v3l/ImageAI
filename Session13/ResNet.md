# ResNet

Why deep, deeper , deepest ?

A Single Layer is enough  given the resource, but leads to overfitting, hence need to go deeper.

Need to go deeper ?

We cant go wide or less layer receptive field with larger kernel- but  OOM

So we go deeper with smaller kernel values and find out edges and gradients, textures and patterns, part of objects, objects - generating receptive field maps.

Convolutions are similar to correlation, and this correlation is done  w.r.t. a receptive field map. If the Receptive Field map is large, then  it would contain different templates for our object. This requires us to add more layers.
